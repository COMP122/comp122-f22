## For Monday Morning Class Only

## Announcements
   1. Grading of 23-, 24-, 25-, 31-
      - these assignments have been graded
      - due dates were honored (with a small time cushion)
      - submission.md files must have been committed by the due date
      - repos MUST have been pushed before grading started
      - your responsibility to know what you submitted

   1. Regrading, Accomodations, Exceptions: to grading
      - You must make an explicit request via a slack DM
      - Your request must state 
        - your github account name
        - which assignment (23-, 24-, 25-, 31-) is in question
        - why you deserve a consideration
      - If you already think you made said request, make it again!

   1. Program:  adminstrative/grade_guesstimator 
      - available -- not fully tested
        * feel free to try and provide feedback
      - all previous grade.report files 
        * augmented with `ASSIGNMENT_[0-9][0-9]_total="1?[0-9][0-9]"`
        * you need to pull all previous assignments, 
          - for the tool to automatically include assignment scores

   1. Noticed that a handful of students pushed past deliverables 
      after after grading was complete.  
      - Do NOT presume that I was even aware that you made said pushes
      - I.e., I did not take them into consideration for grading.

   1. Quiz is scheduled for the weekend of 17th
      - the quiz must be completed with a 2 hour timeframe
      - but you have a large window (48 hours ?) over the weekend to self-schedule the quiz time.

   1. Grading of 30- is scheduled to be done over Thanksgiving
   1. Start of a new section: MIPS Assembly
