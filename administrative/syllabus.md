## [Class Schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uIOXxD7ZS493IKF9qqYf2KeQtfmE0fTXgGXtjZrDoWY) (with tentative dates of quizzes/exams):
  1. Models for Communication and Computation	(Online Quiz #1: 9/18)
  1. Data Formats and Encodings for Computing (In-class Exam #2: 10/17 & 10/18)
  1. Digital Logic: Combinational and Sequential Circuits	(Online Quiz #3: 10/29)
  1. Assembly-Level Programming (In-class Exam #4: 12/7 & 12/8)

## Course Material:
  1.  This class requires you to have direct and continual access to a computer. In short, it is a de facto requirement to bring a computer to lecture and lab.
  1. You should be familiar with the Linux CLI (command line interface)
  1. This class requires you to use numerous tools and online resources.

## Course Description (from the Catalog):
Grade of C or better   COMP 110/L; Grade of C or better in MATH 103, 104, 105, 150A or 255A, or a passing score on the Math Placement Test (MPT) that satisfies prerequisites for MATH 150A or 255A; Lower Division writing requirement.

Introduction to computer architecture, assembly language programming, system software and computer applications. Number systems and data representation. Internal organization of a computer. Primitive instructions and operations. Assembly language.

## Class Objectives:
  * To illustrate the practical use of various numbering systems and data representations
  * To introduce programming approaches and techniques at the hardware/software interface
  * To expose the students to digital logic and computer engineering
  * To foreshadow salient material from Computational Theory (COMP310), Operating Systems (COMP322) and Complilers (COMP430) as it relates to computer architecture
  * To utilize various tools used within the COMP & CIT industry 

## Things to Note:
  *	My goal is NOT to make this an easy class, but to maximize the amount of learning. 
  * I provide a lot information to provide context and to foreshadow material in future classes.
  * Don’t get overwhelmed with the information flow, don’t focus on details but on concepts and relationships.
  * The best way to be successful in this class is to be engaged!
  * The more you put into the class, the more you will benefit.
  * All class-related questions, comments, etc., are to be posted on Slack.

## Course Topics:
The following high-level topics will be reviewed, covered or introduced in class:	

  * Models of Computations and Communications:		
    * Universal Computer, Turning Machine, etc. 
    * OSI and TCP/IP Communication Models
    * Instruction Set Architectures (CISC versus RISC)
    * Operating Systems and Execution Models
  
  * Encoding ad Mappings
    * Table Methods: e.g., ASCII, UTF-8, base64
    * Numbering Systems
    * Base Conversions
    * Binary Numbering Representations and mathematical operations
    * Floating Point Representation 

  * Boolean Logic
    * Combinatorial Circuits
    * Sequential Circuits
    * Pipeline Architectures


  * Introduction to Assembly Language
    * Three Address Code and Control Flow
    * MIPS Assemble Language
    * Operational Semantics: Control Flow
    * Parameter Passing: Registers, stacks, frames and buffers

## Course Evaluation:
The course evaluation for both COMP 122 and COMP 122L are unified. The instructor does not make a distinction between the lecture and lab meetings and utilizes the entire time as appropriate to cover the material and projects as necessary. Each student will be evaluated and will assigned the same letter grade for both COMP122 and COMP122L. This grade should reflect the quality and quantity of knowledge that the student acquired via this course. (It is all about learning!) 

Note that there is 15% percentage associated with participation. A student may demonstrate in various ways their involvement in the class. Through this involvement, I gain a better understanding of what you, and the class as a whole, has learned and what material needs to be reinforced or reviewed to strengthen the learning process.  

Students are expected to work diligently and consistently throughout the semester.  Students that procrastinate till the end in hopes that they can crunch and cram just prior to the final are sadly mistaken.

The table below provides the objective measures used to calculate a student's final grade. 

| Type | Weight |
|------|-------:|
| Participation, Exercises, Assignments, and Activities | 15% |
| Laboratory Assignments	| 40% |
| Quizzes (2)	| 15% |
| Exams (2)	| 30% |

						
Regardless of the structure used to assign a quantitative number to each student, it is the Professor's goal to assign a final quantitative number that is closely aligned with the student's qualitative understanding of the course content. Your active participation in this class is central to demonstrating course knowledge.

## Recording of Class/Lecture Presentations
A student may freely record either class or lecture presentations. Such recordings, however, are for the individual use of the student or students currently enrolled in COMP122/L.  As such students may share their recordings with other students in the class, who have the same restrictions, but they may not otherwise post or disseminate said recordings.


##	Course Policies
I encourage everyone to collaborate, to work in teams, and to discuss course material with your colleagues. All student submissions, however, must be the work of the student who has submitted the material. Students should therefore be familiar with the University's rules on academic dishonesty, which can be found in the Undergraduate/Graduate Catalog. In particular, plagiarism will not be tolerated! Any student caught plagiarizing any work may automatically receive a grade of F for the course. If you are unsure as to what constitutes plagiarism, it is your responsibility to check with the instructor. Other forms of dishonesty will result in similar actions.
					
<b>Note:</b> Changes may be (will be) needed to this syllabus and the course plan. All such changes will be announced in class and posted on the class website. Students are responsible for this information.
