## Today's Material

  1. Walk through 
  ```
  int series(int a, int b) {
    int x;
    int i;

    x = a - b;
    system.out.printf("%d", x);
    system.out.printf("\n");

    for (i=a; i<b; i++) {
      system.out.printf("%d", i);
      system.out.printf(",");
    }
    system.out.printf("%d\n", i);
    return b - a;
  }
